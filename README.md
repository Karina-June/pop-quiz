# pop-quiz
This is a pop quiz on the famous movie, "It's A Wonderful Life".
When selecting your answer you are taken to the next question and a message will appear at the botton of the page weather you got the question right or wrong. 


I'm not sure why the deployed page looks like this. I did the same as last time and I've never had this problem before.
